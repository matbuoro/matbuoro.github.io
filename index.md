# Eco-evolutionary dynamics of freshwater fishes  

My research interests focus on two related areas. The first is the adaptation of freshwater fish to environmental change. The second is the adapative management of fish populations.

My research combines the long-term monitoring of fish popualtions *in natura* via the tagging and tracking of individually-marked fish (e.g., Atlantic salmon population on the [Scorff river](https://www6.inra.fr/ore-pfc/Sites-d-etudes/Scorff)) and, by integrating local and scientific knowledge, to predict the response of populations to climate change and human pressure using  simulation methods (e.g., [IBASAM](https://github.com/Ibasam)).

# Evolutionary demography

Understanding the origin of life history variations of organisms, and then their capacity of adaptation to environmental change, requires studying life history strategies and evolutionary processes that drive them. My primary research goals are directed toward investigating _eco-evolutionary dynamics_ and the impacts on demography (_evolutionary demography_). It involves exploring _life history evolution_, _dispersal strategies_ and associated _evolutionary processes_ in the wild such as selective survival, evolutionary trade-offs (e.g., cost of reproduction) and phenotypic plasticity (e.g., conditional strategies).  


I'm particularly interested by _integrative approach_, e.g. integrating within a single and coherent framework demography, evolutionary processes such as life history decisions and evolutionary trade-offs, while explicitly represent the underlying mechanisms that generate our observations (e.g. physiological mechanisms or capture processes).

# Modeling  

I developed skills in quantitative biology, including familiarity with Individual-Based Modeling and Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling to explore complex models (state-space modeling, structural equation modeling, and quantitative genetics methods). Within these frameworks, one can confront theories and concepts in evolutionary biology with observational data through appropriate statistical tools.
