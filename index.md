My primary research goals are directed toward investigating _eco-evolutionary dynamics_ and understanding the origin of life history variations of organisms. It requires studying life history strategies and evolutionary processes that drive them, such as selective survival, evolutionary trade-offs (e.g., cost of reproduction) and phenotypic plasticity (e.g., conditional strategies).  


I'm particularly interested by _integrative approach_, i.e. integrating within a single and coherent framework demography and evolutionary processes, while explicitly represent the underlying mechanisms that generate our observations (e.g. proximate mechanisms or observation processes).  


For that purpose, I developed skills in quantitative biology (or computational biology), including familiarity with Individual-Based Modeling and Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling to explore complex patterns and interactions. Within these frameworks, one can confront theories and concepts in evolutionary biology with observational data through appropriate statistical tools.
