# Interests:  
Eco-Evolutionary dynamic, Evolution of life histories & Life history strategies, dispersal strategies, Quantitative ecology.


# Current position:  
Posdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkeley.

My primary research goals are directed toward investigating eco-evolutionary dynamics in the wild. 

It involves the study of adaptation of organisms to environmental change through life history strategies, life history evolution, dispersal strategies and evolutionary processes in the wild.  


I have strong skills in quantitative biology, including familiarity with Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling to explore complex model, state-space modeling, structural equation modeling, and quantitative genetics methods.  


I have explored evolutionary process in the wild such as selective survival, evolutionary trade-offs (e.g., cost of reproduction) and phenotypic plasticity (e.g., conditional strategies) while estimating associated demographic parameters (survival, migration). I also have experience in quantitative genetic methods with the estimations of heritability combining CR methods and animal model. My futur research plans are aimed at investigating eco-evolutionary dynamics among organisms from data collected in the wild.
